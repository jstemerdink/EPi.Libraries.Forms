NOTE: You will have to set the 'renderingFormUsingDivElement' settting to true in the Forms.config, located in modules\_protected\EPiServer.Forms
NOTE: If you used the previuos version, and have not made any changes in the ElementBlocks yourself other then me rendering a div tag instead of the form tag, you can remove them.
